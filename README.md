Zendroidcomic is an experiment porting Zencomic ([http://neteril.org/projects/zencomic/](http://neteril.org/projects/zencomic/)) to Android.

It mainly consists in a fullscreen gallery automatically filled with random webcomics (the likes of Dilbert, XKCD, Lolcats or Garfield) as you swipe to the right. No more, no less.

It's also presently not configurable, coming eventually...
